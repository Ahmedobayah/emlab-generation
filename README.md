EMLab-Generation - Adjusting the CO2 cap to subsidised RES generation: Can CO2 prices be decoupled from renewable policy?

This branch of the EMLab-Generation model, contains the version, as well as complete input data, used for the paper Adjusting the CO2 cap to subsidised RES generation: Can CO2 prices be decoupled from renewable policy?

With the R-script adaptiveCO2-DualNode-scenarioFileCreator.R, the necessary scenario files for reproducing the model results of the paper can be created. For manual inspection of the input data, have a look at the following files and locations:

adaptiveCO2-DualNode-scenarioTemplate.xml is the template from which the Monte-Carlo simulation files are created, using a R-script, which substitutes placeholders by the actual scenario values.
More complex input data is contained in the following folder: https://github.com/EMLab/emlab-generation/tree/paper/resCapAdaption/emlab-generation/src/main/resources/data
