EMLab-Generation - Cross-border electricity market effects due to price caps in an emission trading system: An Agent-Based Approach

This branch of the EMLab-Generation model, contains the version, as well as complete input data, used for the paper "Cross-border electricity market effects due to price caps in an emission trading system: An Agent-Based Approach".

With the R-script co2priceCaps-scenarioFileCreator.R, the necessary scenario files for reproducing the model results of the paper can be created. For manual inspection of the input data, have a look at the following files and locations:

* co2priceCaps-scenarioTemplate.xml and parametersU-co2PriceCaps.properties are the templates from which the Monte-Carlo simulation files are created, using a R-script, which substitutes placeholders by the actual scenario values. 
* More complex input data is contained in the following folder: https://github.com/EMLab/emlab-generation/tree/paper/co2PriceCaps/emlab-generation/src/main/resources/data
